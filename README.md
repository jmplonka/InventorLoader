# InventorLoader
Loads/Imports: Autodesk (R) Inventor (R) files into FreeCAD (v0.18 or greater). 
Until now only Parts (IPT) but not assemblies (IAM) or drawings (IDW) or presentations (IPN) can be displayed.

As Inventor files contains a complete ACIS model representation, SAT and SAB files can also be 
imported into FreeCAD.

As Fusion360 files contains a complete ACIS model representation these files can also be opened in FreeCAD.
## Status:
**Released 1.5**

## Screenshots
[Demo-Status](https://github.com/jmplonka/InventorLoader/tree/master/Demo-Status/) subdirectory shows examples of this Addon.

## Prerequisites
[FreeCAD](https://freecadweb.org/downloads.php) v0.17 or greater required!

This Addon also requires additional python packages:
* https://pypi.python.org/pypi/xlrd - for reading embedded Excel workbooks
* https://pypi.python.org/pypi/xlwt - for writing embedded Excel workbooks
* http://www.decalage.info/python/olefileio - olefile for reading Microsoft OLE(2)
    files.

## Installation
### Automatic Install (recommended)
Installable via the FreeCAD [Addon Manager](https://www.freecadweb.org/wiki/Std_AddonMgr).  
Requires a restart after downloading this addon.  

### Manual Install
1. Create a directory in either two locations where FreeCAD searches for
addons:  
  a. FreeCAD's `bin` folder, or  
  b. in the user's application data (`%APPDATA%` on Windows) or home (`~/`) folder (on Linux/MacOS).  
2. Create a `Mod` subdirectory if one doesn't exist and/or move in to it. 
3. Download the InventorLoader repository as either:  
  a. [ZIP archive](https://github.com/jmplonka/InventorLoader/archive/master.zip), or via  
  b.`git clone https://github.com/jmplonka/InventorLoader.git`  
and expand its content directly into the
FreeCAD subdirectory named `Mod`.  
3. Start (or restart) FreeCAD  

The next time FreeCAD starts new import formats for ACIS' SAT (\*.sat) files and Autodesk 
Inventor's IPT (\*.ipt) files as will be available and supported import formats.

**Note:** Please pre-install the [Prerequisite](https://github.com/jmplonka/InventorLoader#prerequisites) python libraries 
so that the new packages become available.

### Solving installation problems
Sometimes it can happen that the packages can't be installed.
1. Navigate to the InventorLoader plugin (ILP) folder with your file-browser (e.g.
   Windows-Explorer)
2. Extract the libs.zip into the ILP's folder (a new subfolder `libs` should be created).
3. Open a command shell (e.g. `cmd` on windows or `sh` on linux)
   1. Adapt the `PATH` variable to point to FreeCAD's python: `set PATH="<PATH-TO-FREECAD>\bin";%PATH%`
      (on linux you have to export the `PATH` variable). **Note**: Linux and MAC users
      should use '/' instead of '\'!
   2. Change the working folder to ILP's `libs` folder (e.g. `cd <PATH-TO-FREECAD>\Mod\InventorLoader-master\libs`)
   3. Run the installation script: `python ./installLibs.py`
      This should install the required packages.
4. Restart FreeCAD

#### Constraints in Native-IPT Import:
Please disable Dimension constraints in user.cfg:
```xml
<FCBool Name="Sketch.Constraint.Dimension.Angle2Line" Value="0"/>
<FCBool Name="Sketch.Constraint.Dimension.Angle3Point" Value="0"/>
```

## Limitations
Export will not be supported - neither IPT nor SAT/SAB or DXF.
Only files from INVENTOR V2010 or newer are supported.

### Feature Based Import

### ACIS (`sat`) Native Import
- Blending surfaces are not yet supported.
- Helix surfaces are not yet supported for lines.
- Interpolated curves and surfaces defined by laws are omitted if they don't have spline data.

### STEP Conversion Import
STEP converts the ACIS data from SAT or IPT files. Therefore any limitation is inherited.

Autodesk Inventor files have OLE2 files.  
This allows embedding Excel workbooks e.g.:  
* The addon is able to read Inventor files from 2010 or newer.
* Read the iProperties (Note: only a few can be applied in FreeCAD).
* Display embedded workbooks as a new spreadsheet when importing as features.
* Three strategies are provided:  
  * **feature base**: the addon tries to rebuild all the features.
  * **SAT based**: like STEP file, model will be imported based on FACE, EDGES and VERTICES.
  * **STEP based**: The ACIS model will be converted into STEP and imported afterwards.

### DXF import
DXF files contains sometimes 3D-Solids. These are represented as SAT/SAB content.
The solids can be imported either using native of STEP conversion.
